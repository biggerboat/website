// Now, you can simply include everything
// (except media) by uncommeting this line

// Or, you can pick and choose only the sections
// you want by using the these includes
@include html5-boilerplate-reset;
@include html5-boilerplate-fonts;
@include html5-boilerplate-styles;

// Or, you can import the "overrides" partial if
// you want more control over individual mixins
//@import "partials/_overrides.scss";

// Finally, put your own styles in these partials
// and add more as needed (i.e. forms, tables, nav)

// Media should come last
